# bobeirasa's dotfiles
Welcome to my dotfiles hub. The objective of this is keep my dotfiles organized, let me scale them among my new servers and computers and of course, share with my friends.

I made a branch from `crayment/dotfiles` because I liked the idea of making a git repo to host my dotfiles, it was not my idea :)
